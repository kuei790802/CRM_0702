## ⚙️ Deployment & Quick Start Guide

This project adopts a decoupled frontend and backend architecture, with React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

### 1\. Live Demo

Our project has been successfully deployed online. You are welcome to experience the full functionality via the following link:
🔗 **Website Link**: [`https://dontwannawork.com`](https://dontwannawork.com) 
### 2\. Get Project Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bennygoat/CRM.git
cd CRM
```

### 3\. Backend Setup

* **Navigate to the `backend/backend` directory.**

* **Configure Database:**
  Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and modify the following settings according to your MySQL environment:

  ```properties
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
  spring.datasource.username=your_username
  spring.datasource.password=your_password
  ```

  Replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your actual settings.

  **Important Note:** Before running the backend application, please ensure your MySQL database has been created and `your_database_name` exists. You can use tools like MySQL Workbench or DBeaver to manage your database.




* **Run Backend Application:**
  ```bash
  # In the backend/backend directory
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run
  ```

  The backend service will run by default on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 4\. Frontend Setup

* **Navigate to the `frontend` directory.**

* **Install Dependencies and Start Development Server:**

  ```bash
  npm install # Install dependencies
  npm run dev # Start development server
  ```

  The frontend application will run by default on `http://localhost:5173` (or as shown in your terminal).

## 📚 API Documentation (Swagger)

Our API documentation is automatically generated via Swagger, providing clear interface descriptions and testing capabilities.

## 💡 Future Outlook (AI Integration - Beginner Concepts)

We are excited about integrating AI technologies into the system. In the initial phase, our envisioned application scenarios include:

* **Smart Recommendations:** Based on customer purchase history and Browse behavior, automatically recommend relevant products or promotional activities to enhance the shopping experience and sales. This can start with simple**Content-based** recommendations, such as suggesting products similar to those already purchased by the customer.
* **Data Trend Analysis:** Utilize basic data aggregation and statistical methods to provide deeper market trend reports, such as analyzing the ROI of different advertising channels and identifying seasonal best-sellers. This will help operators make more informed business decisions.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Apply simple thresholding or statistical models to automatically detect unusual orders, abnormal inventory fluctuations, and issue timely alerts to prevent potential risks. For example, setting thresholds for daily order counts or individual order amounts.

These functionalities will be introduced incrementally in a modular fashion to ensure system stability and maintainability.
